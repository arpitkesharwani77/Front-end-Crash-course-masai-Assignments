-Implementation function takes voters array as a input and returns the sample output .

-the values are the count of object meet the condition.

-numYoungVotes: voters age <= 20 and given the vote,

-numYoungPeople: voters age <= 20,

-numMidVotesPeople: voters age and age<=45 and given the vote,

-numMidsPeople: voters age and ageÂ« =45,

-numOldVotesPeople: voters age and given the vote,

-numOldsPeople: voters age >45,
